## 0.9.3

### Important Changes 
- [jdbc-v2] SQL parser from v1 is ported to v2 to address multiple issues with SQL parsing. The ANTLR4-based parser is 
still an option and will be developed further. The main difference between parses is completeness of their grammar:
JavaCC grabs only needed information and skips parsing of the rest (what makes it work for most cases) while ANTLR4 
has more complete grammar and can detect type of some complex statements more accurate than JavaCC.
To use it set `com.clickhouse.jdbc.DriverProperties#SQL_PARSER` to `ANTLR4`.
  (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/2579). This fixes issue:

  - https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/2527

- [repo] New artifact `clickhouse-jdbc-all` added to address issue when maven package qualifiers may not be used. 
This artifact should is a copy of `clickhouse-jdbc:all` but should be used only when required. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/2625) 

### Improvements 
- [client-v2] Added `getShortArray()` and `getStringArray()` to `ClickHouseBinaryFormatReader`.  (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/2604)
- [client-v2] Added `result_rows` and `elapsed_time` to summary object. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/1633/files)

### Bug Fixes
- [jdbc-v2] Fixed issue with `maxRows` in `Statement` when additional settings were used to limit result set size.
It caused problems with read-only users because such users may not change settings in most cases. Now when `maxRows` is 
set then `ResultSet` will skip extra rows. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/2582)
- [jdbc-v2] Fixed issue with driver version. Previously version of a library was converted to minor and major version.
But this approach doesn't work well with `0.9.x` versions. Now major and minor versions are combined by shifting major. 
Patch version becomes a minor version. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/2410)
- [jdbc-v2, client-v2] Fixed converting different data types to a string. For example, there was an issue with IP 
address when `toString()` was used and returned `\0.0.0.0` instead of `0.0.0.0`. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/2575)
- [jdbc-v2] Fixed issues around spatial data (GEO types). (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/2577)

server context. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/2247)
- [client-v2] Fixed issue with network timeout settings when default value failed to be cast to Long. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/2597)
- [jdbc-v2] Fixed getting metadata for nullable columns. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/2586)
- [jdbc-v2, client-v2] Fixed issues related to reading JSON data type. Fixed reading JSON columns with arrays. Previously was causing exceptions like 
`com.clickhouse.client.api.ClientException: Unsupported data type with tag 101 at ...`
(https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/2598, https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/2593,
  https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/2613, https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/2102)
- [client-v2] Fixed configuration parameter type for `socket_linger` to match documentation. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/2524)
- [client-v2] Fixed handling exceptions in http client code. Now response object is always closed to prevent connection leaking. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/2615)
- [jdbc-v2, client-v2] Fixed issue with duplicate column names in a result set. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/2459, https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/2336)
- [jdbc-v2] Fixed ANTLR4 parse issue with `filter` clause along with aggregate function. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/2631)

Improved test coverage for `ResultSetImpl`. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/2530)
- [jdbc-v2] Implemented `createArray` and `createStruct` methods for `Connection` interface. Method `createStruct`
should be used to create `Tuple` values and `createArray` to create various arrays. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/2523)
- [jdbc-v2] Implemented `setNetworkTimeout` of `Connection` interface. Used to fail fast when network operation fails. Related to
stale connection problem. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/2522)
- [client-v2] Added support for JSON with predefined paths. Previously columns with definition like `JSON(a string, b.c Int32)`
were not supported. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/2531)

- [jdbc-v2] Fixed `DatabaseMetadataImpl` to return result set with defined by spec structure. Resolves issue for many database tools
relying on metadata. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/2396)
- [jdbc-v2] Fixed `DatabaseMetadataImpl` to return empty result set where appropriate. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/2517)
- [jdbc-v2] Fixed issue with verbose logging. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/2148)

### Improvements
- [client-v2] Improved exceptions and error handling. The `com.clickhouse.client.api.ClickHouseException` became a root for 
`ServerException` and `ClientException`. `com.clickhouse.client.api.ClickHouseException.isRetryable` is added to determine if 
exception caused in a retriable state. It means that catching such exception application may repeat operation to fix a 
problem. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/2453)
- [client-v2] Improved configuration handling. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/2470)
- [client-v2] Custom type hint for the client to make `Reader` and `GenericRecord` return specific types. For example,

### Docs
- [client-v2] Updated documentation of the configuration parameters and how to set server settings and custom HTTP headers.

## 0.8.6 

### Improvements
- [jdbc-v2] Now using Antlr4 to parse SQL statements to get meta information about it. 
Invalid SQL still possible to execute if logic able to get all required information. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/2351)
- [jdbc-v2] Now possible to use `RowBinaryWriter` if enabled by property `com.clickhouse.jdbc.internal.DriverProperties.BETA_ROW_BINARY_WRITER`.
This works well for batches. Single statements may get no benefits. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/2316)

### Bug Fixes

- [jdbc-v2] Fixed handling UUID data type in PreparedStatement. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/2327)
- [jdbc-v2] Fixed unsigned integer type matching. `UInt8`, `UInt16`, `UInt32`, `UInt64`, `UInt128`, `UInt256` are presented as 
`short`, `int`, `long`, `BigInteger`, `BigInteger`, `BigInteger` correspondingly. SQLType for them is `OTHER` because 
JDBC (as well as Java) doesn't provide good mapping for unsigned integers. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/2333)
- [jdbc-v2] Disallowed to call method from `Statement` interface on `PreparedStatement` instance according to the JDBC spec. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/2339)

## 0.8.4

### Examples

## 0.8.1 

### New Features
- [client-v2] - Added support for Variant Data Type for RowBinary format. Can be read into a POJO or using a reader.
Writing is supported only for POJO. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/2130)    
- [client-v2] - Added support for Dynamic Data Type for RowBinary format. Can be read into a POJO or using a reader.
  Writing is supported only for POJO. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/2130)

### Bug Fixes 
- [client-v2] - Fixed `getTableSchema(tableName, databaseName)` now it doesn't ignore database name. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/2139)
- [client-v2] - Fixed `returnGeneratedValues` to not throw an exception. Keep in mind that ClickHouse doesn't support 
returning anything in response for `INSERT` statements. This change was done just to make client usable with certain frameworks. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/2121)
- [jdbc-v2] - Fixed changing database by `USE` statement. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/2137)
- [jbdc-v2] - Fixed `ResultSetMetadata.getColumnClassName()` to return null instead of throwing exception. This change is done only 
to allow certain frameworks work with the client. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/2112)

## 0.8.0

### Highlights
- We've updated `ClickHouseDriver` and `ClickHouseDataSource` to default to using the new (`jdbc-v2`) implementation of the JDBC driver. Setting `clickhouse.jdbc.v1=true` will revert this change.

#### JDBC Changes
- `jdbc-v2` - Removed support for Transaction Support. Early versions of the driver only simulated transaction support, which could have unexpected results.
- `jdbc-v2` - Removed support for Response Column Renaming. `ResultSet` was mutable - for efficiency sake they're now read-only
- `jdbc-v2` - Removed support for Multi-Statement SQL. Multi-statement support was only simulated, now it strictly follows 1:1
- `jdbc-v2` - Removed support for Named Parameters. Not part of the JDBC spec
- `jdbc-v2` - Removed support for Stream-based `PreparedStatement`. Early version of the driver allowed for non-jdbc usage of `PreparedStatement` - if you desire such options, we recommend looking at client-v2.

### New Features
- [client-v2, jdbc-v2] - Added support for Bearer token authentication like JWT. Now it is possible to specify encoded token while
creating a client and change while runtime using `com.clickhouse.client.api.Client.updateBearerToken`. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/1834, https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/1988) 
- [client-v2] - Exposed connection pool metrics through Micrometer. It allows to monitor internal connection pool for number of active and leased connections. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/1901) 

### Bug Fixes
- [client-v2] - Fixed construction of `User-Agent` header. Prev. implementation uses `class.getPackage().getImplementationVersion()` what returns
incorrect title and version when library is shaded. New implementation uses build time information from resource files generated while build. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/2007)
- [client-v2] - Fixed multiple issues with handling connectivity disruption. Socket timeout is unlimited by default. Added retry on timeout. Added more information to exception message.
Please read the issue for more details. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/1994)
- [client-v2] - Client doesn't close provided executor anymore letting application close it instead. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/1956)
- [client-v2] - Removed unnecessary initialization to make startup time shorter. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/2032)  

## 0.7.2 

### New Components 
- `jdbc-v2` - pre-release version of upcoming `clickhouse-jdbc` replacement. Supports basic functionality, works only with `client-v2`.
More information will be available after its release

### Highlights
- [repo] Added shaded packages with requires a set of dependencies. Use `all` classified for `client-v2` full package. 
Use `shaded-all` for old jdbc driver.
- [client-v2] New Data Writer API was added. It allows to gain a control over writing data to low-level output stream. 
This API makes it possible to write compressed data directly to server. See `com.clickhouse.client.api.Client#insert(java.lang.String, com.clickhouse.client.api.DataStreamWriter, com.clickhouse.data.ClickHouseFormat, com.clickhouse.client.api.insert.InsertSettings)`
(https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/2034)


### New Features
- [client-v2] Added ability to specify client name. It means `User-Agent` will be filled with proper information (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/1948)
- [client-v2] Implemented statement parameters for `queryAll` and `queryRecords` API methods. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/1979) 
- [client-v2] Implemented string to number conversion. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/2014)

## 0.7.0

### Deprecations
- Following deprecated components are removed:
  - clickhouse-cli-client
  - clickhouse-grpc-client

### Important Changes
- [client-v2] New transport layer implementation is used by default. It is still possible to switch back 
using old implementation by setting `com.clickhouse.client.api.Client.Builder#useNewImplementation` to `false`. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/1847)

### New Features
- [client-v2] Now there is an easy way to set custom HTTP headers globally for client and per operation. 
See `com.clickhouse.client.api.Client.Builder.httpHeader(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)` for details. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/1782)
- [client-v2] Now there is a way to set any server settings globally for client and per operation.
See `com.clickhouse.client.api.Client.Builder.serverSetting(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)` for details. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/1782)
- [client-v2] Added support for writing AggregateFunction values (bitmap serialization). !! Reading is not 
supported but will be added in the next release. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/1814)
- [r2dbc] Defer connection creation. This allows pool to create a new instance on every subscription, 
instead of always returning the same one. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/1810) 

### Performance Improvements
- [client-v2] Improved reading fixed length data like numbers. It is possible to configure readers to 
use pre-allocated buffers to avoid memory allocation for each data row/block. Significantly reduces GC pressure.
See `com.clickhouse.client.api.Client.Builder.allowBinaryReaderToReuseBuffers` for details. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/1816)
- [client-v2] New API method introduced to read data directly to a POJO. Deserializers for POJO classes are compiled into 
bytecode (with help of https://asm.ow2.io/ library) and optimized for each schema. It is great performance boost 
because data is read without copying it into temporary structures. Code can be optimized by JVM while runtime as SerDe 
code is implemented without reflection using JVM bytecode. Using bytecode makes handling primitive types without values boxing. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/1794, 
https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/1826)
- [client-v2] Optimized reading columns - internally data is read into map of column-values. It is done 
to allow reading same column more than once. Previously map was cleared each row what caused a lot 
internal objects creation. Now values are overridden because schema doesn't change between rows. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/1795)

### Documentation
- [client-v2] Added example for Kotlin (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/1793)
- [doc] Main documentation on official ClickHouse website is updated. Each client has its own page with detailed information now. 
Added documentation for the Client V2. See https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/integrations/java.

### Bug Fixes
- [client-v2] Fix for cases when missing operation metrics were causing NPE. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/1846)
- [client-v2] Fix for handling empty result by BinaryFormat readers. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/1845)
- [jdbc] Content of an artifact 'clickhouse-jdbc-{version}-all.jar' is fixed and contains all required classes from `clickhouse-client` 
and `clickhouse-data`. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/1842)
- [client-v1, jdbc] Endpoints definition parsing fixed to grub properties correctly. Now even properties with key-value 
pairs are supported. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/1841, https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/1665)

### Performance Improvements
- [client-v2] `queryAll()` optimized to use less memory (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/1779)
- [client-v2] `Client.Builder#setClientNetworkBufferSize` introduced to allow increasing a buffer that is used 
to transfer data from socket buffer to application memory. When set to >= of send/receive socket buffer size it
significantly reduces number of system calls and improves performance. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/1784)

### New Features
- [client-v2] Client will retry on `NoHttpResponseException` when using Apache HTTP client. 
  It is useful when close/stale connection is leased from connection pool. No client will 
retry one more time instead of failing. `Client.Builder#retryOnFailures` and `Client.Builder#setMaxRetries` were 
introduced to configure client behavior. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/1768)

### Bug Fixes
- [client-v2] Correct timezone used when reading DateTime values. Affects how date/datetime values
  are read when `session_timezone` is used (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/1780)
- [client-v2] Fix reading big integers. Previously was causing incorrect values
  (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/1786)
  (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/1776)
- [client-v2] Fix server compressions when using a client instance concurrently 
(https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/1791) 
- [client-v2] Fix reading arrays as list. Also affected reading nested arrays (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/1800)

### New Features 
- [Client-V1/Apache HTTP] More configuration parameters for connection management. Useful for tuning performance.
(https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/1771)
    - com.clickhouse.client.config.ClickHouseClientOption#CONNECTION_TTL - to configure connection time-to-live
    - com.clickhouse.client.http.config.ClickHouseHttpOption#KEEP_ALIVE_TIMEOUT - to configure keep-alive timeout
    - com.clickhouse.client.http.config.ClickHouseHttpOption#CONNECTION_REUSE_STRATEGY - defines how connection pool behaves.
If `FIFO` is selected then connections are reused in the order they were created. It results in even distribution of connections.
If `LIFO` is selected then connections are reused as soon they are returned to the pool. 
Note: only for `APACHE_HTTP_CLIENT` connection provider. 
    - Additionally switched to using LAX connection pool for Apache Connection Manager to improve performance 
for concurrent requests.
- [Client-V2] Connection pool configuration https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/1766
    - com.clickhouse.client.api.Client.Builder.setConnectionRequestTimeout - to configure connection request timeout.
Important when there are no connections available in the pool to fail fast. 
    - com.clickhouse.client.api.Client.Builder.setMaxConnections - configures how soft limit of connections per host.
Note: Total number of connections is unlimited because in most cases there is one host.
    - com.clickhouse.client.api.Client.Builder.setConnectionTTL - to limit connection live ignoring keep-alive from server.
    - com.clickhouse.client.api.Client.Builder.setConnectionReuseStrategy - to configure how connections are used.
Select FIFO to reuse connections evenly or LIFO (default) to reuse the most recently active connections.
- [Client-V2] All operations are now executed in calling thread to avoid extra threads creation. 
Async operations can be enabled by `com.clickhouse.client.api.Client.Builder.useAsyncRequests` (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/1767)
- [Client-V2] Content and HTTP native compression is supported now Currently only LZ4 is available. (https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/1761)

(https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/1698)

### New Features
- [Client-V1/Apache HTTP] Retry on NoHttpResponseException in Apache HTTP client.
Should be used with causes because it is not always possible to resend request body. 
Behaviour is controlled by `com.clickhouse.client.http.config.ClickHouseHttpOption#AHC_RETRY_ON_FAILURE`.
Works only for Apache HTTP client because based on its specific behavior(https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/1721)
- [Client-V1/Apache HTTP] Connection validation before sending request.
Behaviour is controlled by `com.clickhouse.client.http.config.ClickHouseHttpOption#AHC_VALIDATE_AFTER_INACTIVITY`.
