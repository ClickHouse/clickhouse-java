Java libraries for connecting to ClickHouse and processing data in various formats. Java client is async, lightweight, and low-overhead library for ClickHouse; while JDBC and R2DBC drivers are built on top of the Java client with more dependencies and features. Java 8 or higher is required to use the libraries. In addition, please use ClickHouse 20.7+ or any of [active releases](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3Arelease).
